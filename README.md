# Deep Learning Classifier: MNIST & CIFAR-10

This project demonstrates deep learning techniques using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on two popular image datasets: **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10**. It includes model building, evaluation, and saving/loading for reuse.

## üîç Tasks Covered

1. **Basic DNN for MNIST**  
   - Simple feedforward neural network.

2. **Deeper DNN for MNIST**  
   - Added more hidden layers for improved accuracy.

3. **DNN with Dropout (MNIST)**  
   - Introduced dropout for better generalization.

4. **CNN for CIFAR-10**  
   - Used convolutional layers to classify 32x32 color images.

5. **Model Saving & Reloading**  
   - Saved and loaded models using `.h5` format.
